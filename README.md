# Team NULL: DroneATM

DroneATM is a mobile ATM system. Users can calls over a drone cash dispenser through an iOS app. The system takes advantage of the Parrot AR.Drone's camera capabilities and uses QR-code based authentication. The app and drone interact with the Nessie API and makes realtime updates to Nessie user accounts. No account balance changes are made until the drone scans the QR-code from the user's phone, this protects the user from drone malfunctions and is inline with Capital One's mission of doing right by the customer.
